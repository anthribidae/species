            Welcome to **Anthribidae of the World Online**, a virtual catalog that aims to facilitate the search of fungus weevil taxa. The taxonomic database is actively fed on [TaxonWorks](https://taxonworks.org) following specialized scientific literature. Specimen records and images are the product of the curation, identification, imaging and digitization of Anthribidae shared by several collections.
